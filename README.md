[Link to Contract](https://github.com/ankitpal1029/NFTMarketPlace/blob/main/frontend-contracts/contracts/LazyNFT.sol)

We have developed a platform for content creators to mint NFTs out of their popular streams and sell it to their audience for a source of revenue.

We have developed a twitch extension which has chat functionality to display their NFTs, and a marketplace for creators to list their NFTs with ease.
Furthermore, to reduce the barrier of entry we employ lazy minting so that the creators donâ€™t need to pay expensive upfront gas fees to mint their NFTs.

We use IPFS protocol to store NFTs in a decentralized way, and use a MongoDB server to store the vouchers generated by lazy minting of NFTs.
